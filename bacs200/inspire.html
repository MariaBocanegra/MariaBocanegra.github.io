        What makes a hero? For me, a hero is not someone that has to save the world or be a "perfect" human being;
        for me, a hero is someone that makes an impact in other peoples' lives and encourages a positive change.
        Everyone has their own hero, someone that refelcts their aspirartions and motivates their goals.

        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strong personality- they are not one to shy away or hide in difficult moments</li>
        <li>Inspires others - they introduce new forms of creativity</li>
        <li>Big impact - impacts the life of others, and generations to come</li>
        <li>Outspoken- they speak up for their beliefs and say what's on their mind</li>
        <li>Tenacious - they never give up when faced with difficult times</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
