    <h2>Top Laugh</h2>
    <p>When I think of funny videos, I think of Tik Tok. Although this may not be found as funny by others, it makes me laugh every time. Since Tik Tok cannot be downloaded onto a PC, I have linked a YouTube clip of the Tik Tok.</p>

    <h2>&lt;Sometimes&gt; Fresh Laughs</h2>
    <p>Anime is one of my favorite things to watch because you're always sure to find humorous moments. It may be hard to understand the jokes if you aren't familiar with the anime, but once you do it's worth it!</p>

    <h2>Old Laughs</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of unfunny things that people in my generation find funny. A lot of it includes making fun of millennial humor because we think we're funnier. Jokes aside, the following link has some great ones.</p>
