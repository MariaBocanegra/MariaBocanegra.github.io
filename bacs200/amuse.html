    <h2>Top Laugh</h2>
    <p>When I think of funny videos, I think of Tik Tok. Although this may not be found as fuuny by others, it makes me laugh everytime. Since Tik Tok cannot be downloaded onto a PC, I have linked a youtube clip of the Tik Tok.</p>

    <h2>&lt;Sometimes&gt; Fresh Laughs</h2>
    <p>Anime is one of my favorite things to watch because you're always sure to find humorous moments. It may be hard to understand the jokes if you aren't familiar with the anime, but once you do it's worth it!</p>
